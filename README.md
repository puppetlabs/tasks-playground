# Tasks Playground

A series of experiments, examples and general play with `bolt`.

The intention of this repository is to:

* Collect simple tasks and plans into one repo
* Collect examples of usage in one place
* Have a place for hacks, tips and tricks
* Provide a source of ideas which could be implemented in `bolt` itself
* Stretch what's possible with `bolt`

Adding new things to this repository should be simple and encouraged, nothing that works is out of scope and no idea a bad idea. This isn't about supported solutions or best practices but about the art of the possible from which those practices tend to grow.

If you've been experimenting with `bolt` feel free to include your experiments here.

## Modules

The `modules/` directory of this repo contains task and plan content to get
started with bolt quickly. To use this content pass `--modules=./modules` when
calling `bolt task` or `bolt plan`.
