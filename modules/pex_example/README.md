# Writing Puppet Tasks in Python

Tasks for `bolt` can be written in any language, they just require the runtime
to be available on the target node. Let's have a look at writing simple Python
tasks to illustrate this.

Save the following as `tasks/init.py`.

Note that the `sample` part is the name of our module. We could have used
anything here but note it's used to build out the user interface as we'll see
in a moment.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
print os.environ['PT_message']
```

Note as well that this is just a standard Python script. It's using the
standard library `os` module and then printing out the `PE_message` environment
variable. Task arguments are automatically passed along to tasks and prefixed
with `PT_` for Puppet Tasks.

The name `init` is special. It means this task is the default for this module,
so if you don't explicitly run a named task the `init` task will be run. Here's
an example of running that task.

```
bolt task run pex_example message=hello --nodes <nodes> --modules ../
```

Note:

* the `--modules` flag points at the modules diretory we created above with out `sample` module in
* the argument `message` matches the name of our environment variable above
* `sample` is the name of our module. We're not naming a task explicitly so bolt will run the `init` task

This is a simple way of running any arbitrary Python code on a large number of
remote nodes, and packaging that code up so it's easy to share with the rest of
your team or the wider community.


## Managing dependencies

The above example just uses the Python standard library. But what if our task
wants to use a third party library? We could just install that library on our
remote machines, but that requires upfront configuration which might not always
be possible. It would be nice if we could rely just on the runtime and nothing
else. Lucily with [Pex](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex) we can do exactly
  that.

Pex is a packaging format for Python which packages up our code along with any
required libraries and can create a single executable. Perfect for distribution
with `bolt`. Let's see a very simple example of doing that.

To create a Pex package we need to have a `setup.py` file. A simple example
might look like the following:

```python
from distutils.core import setup

setup(
    name='samplepkg',
    version='0.1',
    packages=['samplepkg'],
)
```

All of the code samples needed to run this example accompany this README.

Next we need to write the code for our task. We'll save that to `samplepkg/main.py`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import colored
from colored import stylize

print(stylize(os.environ['PT_message'], colored.fg("red")))
```

We'll also need a blank file at `samplepkg/__init__.py` to indicate that `samplepkg` is a Python package.

Note in the above we're using the
[colored](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colored) Python package from PyPi. We're
using that to style the printing of the output in red.

Finally we need to build the pex package. For that you'll need to install Pex:

```
pip install pex
```

And finally build the intermediary wheel and save the `.pex` file to our tasks
folder.

```
pip wheel -w . .
pex -f ${PWD} samplepkg colored -e samplepkg.main -o tasks/samplepkg.pex
```

We can now run our task. Note the `::samplepkg` part of the command below. `::`
separates the module name from the task name. `samplepkg.pex` is the filename of
our `pex` file above so `samplepkg` is the task name

```
bolt task run pex_example::samplepkg message=color --nodes <nodes> --modules ../
```

This should print out the message in red rather than the default terminal
color. Obviously printing output in a different color is just a simple example
of the kinds of things you can do. This approach makes it trivial to use the
huge Python ecosystem of libraries to help write tasks to automate your
infrastructure.
